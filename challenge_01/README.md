# Code and Coffee, LB
## Challenge 1 - November 14-21, 2015

Turn the [Code and Coffee LB logo ASCII art](coffee.txt) into a bitmapped image (BMP, GIF, JPEG, or any other bitmap format of your choice).

### Ways to Win

1. Most novel/interesting solution
2. Most solutions shared
3. Most absurdly overengineered solution (the Rube Goldberg Prize)

### How to submit

Any of these are fine:
* Post it on our Slack
* Ceate a Gist and share it
* Create a repo and share it
* Add it to our challenges repo

If you decide to add it to our challenges repo, please:

* Create a new branch with your username and add it to that branch
* For this challenge, add it to ```challenge_01/your-username/```
* If you have multiple solutions, you should create a separate folder for each under ```challenge_01/your-username/```; for example, if I had a CANVAS and a python solution I'd add them to ```challenge_01/rogerhoward/canvas/``` and ```challenge_01/rogerhoward/python/```
* Be sure to include a README.md in your directories, comment your code well, and try to explain your solution
